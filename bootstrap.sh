# Arch Linux Bootstrap Script
#
# This script acts as the "Stage 0" bootloader for the installation process.
# It ensures the minimal viable environment exists (Network, Git, Rust)
# before handing control over to the compiled Rust "Install Wizard".
#
# Security Features:
# 1. Enforces non-root execution (to comply with makepkg security).
# 2. Uses "Fail Fast" mode (set -e) to prevent partial state corruption.
# 3. Validates network connectivity before attempting package operations.

# --- Safety Flags ---
# -e: Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
# -E: Inherit the ERR trap in subshells.
set -eE

# Error Trap: Provides a line number context if the script crashes.
trap 'echo -e "\n❌ Bootstrap failed at line $LINENO"; exit 1' ERR

# --- Context Resolution ---
# Robustly determine the script's physical location, handling symlinks.
